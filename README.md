Part 1: Data
In this dataset, the sampling method was random and stratified sampling have been used to collect the data. Also, this is a observational study from different states in the USA that can be generalize to the whole population of world. However, no causality can be gain by this data. Also, this is very important when and what time these data collected, and it was good or bad day for the respondent.This is easily can effect the results and answers. Also, Number Of Days Physical and mental Health Not Good can be very bias respond because most of people dont remember.In addition, most of people lie in the questionnaire about Chronic Health Conditions, and they can cause big bias. Finally, although this dataset collected by the random phone numbers, the people are not selected to this experiment. Therfore, no causation can be determined by this dataset and we just can measure the correlation and association between the variables.
